# Thanks
- The [Pacifica](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pacifica+online) game and our game development team of 4 (year 2010-2024). Without it, I won't have any reason to develop a programming language. Cp1 (formerly named GLC) was my side project during my game development years to solve the slow compilation of C++.
- [Fabrice Bellard](https://bellard.org/) for his two wonderful creation: TCC and QuickJS. Used in Cp1.
- The [Lemon Parser](https://sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/doc/lemon.html) generator. Used in Cp1.
- The [re2c](https://re2c.org/) lexer. Used in Cp1.
- The members of the C community, especially the GCC and Clang compiler.
